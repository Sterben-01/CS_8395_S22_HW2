# Discription
This project can generate an AR model and some text on certain book cover. Also there are a virtual button can let you do something when you cover the button area.

# How to interact with it
In my code, when you cover the barcode area of the back cover, it will display the short view.

# How to use
Download all project then click play button

# Tips
I already packaged up two models with pose file in 01(1).unitypackage. You can import and use it directly.

# Deficient
This code works not really well especially your book cover is not clearly enough or color/texture/content not really obvious. Also, the virtual button has a significant issue. It is really hard to use and hard to interacive. At the same time, it does not has a proper sensitivity.
